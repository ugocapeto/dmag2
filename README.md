# dmag2

Written and tested on Ubuntu 22.04.

Creates a depth map (disparity map) from a stereo pair using local matching.

This repo is an implementation of

[Adaptive Support-Weight Approach for Correspondence Search by Kuk-Jin Yoon et al.](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.899.2691&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

To create the executable, compile the code in directory "dmag2" using "make -f Makefile_g/Makefile_O" and then go into the "main" directory and create the exec using "make".

Test cases are given in the "test" directory.
